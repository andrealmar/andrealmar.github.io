		<p>On February of 2018 I decided to leave my old job to pursue new goals. I was there for about two and a half years, and it was time to part ways. I’ve being focusing on DevOps space in the last couple of years. I’ve even become a Meetup organizer here in my city. If you want to join us please check out <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pt-BR/DevOps-Belo-Horizonte/" target="_blank">DevOps BH</a>.</p>

<p>My relationship with <a href="http://appprova.com.br" target="_blank">AppProva</a> started couple years ago while I was the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pt-BR/Dojo-Minas/" target="_blank">BH Coding Dojo</a> organiser. They always hand over some space for us to do the Coding Dojo there and I will always be thankful for that.</p>

<p>When I left my old job, I had something lined up but it turns out that it didn’t worked out very well for me. Rapidly, I’ve heard that AppProva was looking for an SRE - Site Reliability Engineer for their office here in Belo Horizonte, MG. I’ve reached out to <a href="https://twitter.com/caironoleto" target="_blank">Cairo</a> who told me to apply even if I had very little experience with Kubernetes at that time. I did that and some interviews later I’m here announcing that I’m joining the team as a Site Reliability Engineer.</p>

<p>There are many technical challenges to be addressed at the company that was just <a href="https://www.baguete.com.br/noticias/17/03/2017/somos-educacao-adquire-appprova" target="_blank">acquired</a> one year ago by a large educational group <a href="http://www.somoseducacao.com.br" target="_blank">SOMOS Educação</a>. I will have the opportunity to work with a great team and learn a lot. This is incredible and I am super excited about the company and the challenges ahead. <strong>#vqv</strong></p>
