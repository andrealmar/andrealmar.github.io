<p>Hi. My full name is Andre Almeida Araujo. But you can call me <code>Andre Almar</code>. ALMAR stands for ‚Äú<strong>ALM</strong>eida <strong>AR</strong>aujo‚Äù, Got it?
I‚Äôm the founder of this blog and a software engineer passionate about programming languages, operating systems, platforms and distributed systems and I&rsquo;m always open and eager to learn. Most of the posts you will see here are based on things I have experienced myself or I was just curious to read, learn and write about. In this blog I do my best to share my musings about the Software Development world. I have a motto: &ldquo;My goal is to achieve excellence in everything I&rsquo;m doing&rdquo;. Oh&hellip;and if you have a good challenge for me, drop me a message and I will be glad to help you out.</p>

<h2 id="how-i-became-who-i-am">How I became Who I am:</h2>

<p>I was born in 1985 in a small town of the Minas Gerais state in Brazil. One day my father came home with a beige box, a monitor, a keyboard and a mice. My father used that box to write texts and print them in his Epson LX810 printer. I became curious about how that big box works and started to learn how to deal with that. Then I&rsquo;ve found inside that PC a game called Actua Soccer. I was mesmerized. That beige box became my first source of fun the whole day. I used to spent hours and hours just playing that game.
<br /><br />
In summer 2002 I started to study Data Processing. In my free time I helped some customers and friends on the development of their websites, so I learned CSS and HTML in order to do that. I made a lot of websites using MS Frontpage. In 2006 I moved to Belo Horizonte (where I currently live) to study Information Technology in a local University. In my course I was exposed to C++, Java and other technologies. But then I saw Python. I fell in love with the language and its simplicity. It was love at a first sight ;)
<br /><br />
After I got my diploma in 2011, I left university to work for several companies doing consulting work in various customers. From government to construction companies I worked with many customers around Latin America. But I was working with enterprise software and I was not feeling the fun anymore. Then I decided to focus more on Python.
<br /><br />
I still do consulting work and rebranded my company <a href="http://www.pydevv.com">PyDevv</a> to focus more on what I want to do for living which is Python (and its related technologies) full-time.
<br /><br />
