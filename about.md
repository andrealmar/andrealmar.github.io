Hi. My name is Andre Almeida Araujo. But you can call me **Andre Almar**. *ALMAR* stands for “**ALM**eida **AR**aujo”, Got it?

I’m a software engineer passionate about programming languages, operating systems, platforms and distributed systems and I’m always open and eager to learn. Most of the posts you will see here are based on things I have experienced myself or I was just curious to read, learn and write about. In this blog I do my best to share my musings about the Software Development world. I have a motto: “My goal is to achieve excellence in everything I’m doing”. Oh…and if you have a good challenge for me, drop me a message and I will be glad to help you out.
