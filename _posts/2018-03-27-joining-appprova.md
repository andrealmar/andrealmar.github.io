On February of 2018 I decided to leave my old job to pursue new goals. I was there for about two and a half years, and it was time to part ways. I've being focusing on DevOps space in the last couple of years. I've even become a Meetup organizer here in my city. If you want to join us please check out [DevOps BH](https://www.meetup.com/pt-BR/DevOps-Belo-Horizonte/){:target="_blank"}.

My relationship with [AppProva](http://appprova.com.br){:target="_blank"} started couple years ago while I was the [BH Coding Dojo](https://www.meetup.com/pt-BR/Dojo-Minas/){:target="_blank"} organiser. They always hand over some space for us to do the Coding Dojo there and I will always be thankful for that.

When I left my old job, I had something lined up but it turns out that it didn't worked out very well for me. Rapidly, I've heard that AppProva was looking for an SRE - Site Reliability Engineer for their office here in Belo Horizonte, MG. I've reached out to [Cairo](https://twitter.com/caironoleto){:target="_blank"} who told me to apply even if I had very little experience with Kubernetes at that time. I did that and some interviews later I'm here announcing that I'm joining the team as a Site Reliability Engineer.

There are many technical challenges to be addressed at the company that was just [acquired](https://www.baguete.com.br/noticias/17/03/2017/somos-educacao-adquire-appprova){:target="_blank"} one year ago by a large educational group [SOMOS Educação](http://www.somoseducacao.com.br){:target="_blank"}. I will have the opportunity to work with a great team and learn a lot. This is incredible and I am super excited about the company and the challenges ahead. **#vqv**
