One of my goals every year is to read more books. I read a lot I must say but it is always good to read more and add knowledge to your brain. After I've found Audible things got easier. I can listen to an Audiobook while I'm at the gym or walking down on the streets. You can also find a lot of Audiobooks on YouTube.

What I want with this kind of post is to share my book list with everybody and maybe have some discussions about it. If you have some suggestion please don't hesitate to tell me. Reading is awesome and opens your mind. You become more proficient and your way of thinking changes. You become better with both speaking and writing. If you don't have reading habit please change it now.

With all of that being said, here is the list:
